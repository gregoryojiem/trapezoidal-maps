Hello!

The required Python imports are fairly standard; numpy, matplotlib, and sys. numpy and matplot lib are only used
for visualizations.

Our program can be run by calling the main.py file and then entering in a text file/path to a text file.
A csv file with adjacency matrix will be outputted to the same folder as the input file
You can optionally add the 'visualize' argument to display a visualization of the DAG similar to the assignment page

Example: main.py test_data/example.txt visualize
